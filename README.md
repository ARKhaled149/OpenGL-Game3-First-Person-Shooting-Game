# OpenGL-Game3-First-Person-Shooting-Game
My friend and I created a game similar to Call of Duty until it was not actually. We used a  cannon as our gun for example and enemies from everywhere are closing in. Once they  get close enough, they hit us, and our health decreases. The first level was on a farm where  giant robots were the enemies while the second level was in the mountains and we are  fighting drones. The game ends when all enemies are destroyed or health has reached 0.
